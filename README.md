The entire premise of Cartoony Weapons is built upon one philosophy: "Work when I want to," as to not force creativity. That being said, Cartoony Weapons is designed to showcase my best work in a single large asset pack; that when compiled together, recreates the world of Team Fortress 2 in a low-poly cube-based reimagination.

		All assets are free for public use, granted you link back to this github and credit accordingly.

If you have any further questions, I have setup a small discord for those interested, to ask said questions: https://discord.gg/Vm6zrBhQnE
